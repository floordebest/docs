### Linx Wallet

Linx Wallet is the only wallet that abstracts away the complexity of the multi-chain architecture of Kadena, making it 
the easiest wallet for new and existing users on the Kadena Blockchain.

Linx Wallet is also the only wallet that has a DEX aggregator inside the wallet, to easily swap inside your application. 
The aggregator spreads your swap over all exchanges on Kadena, giving you the best possible result without having
to worry on what chains your tokens are.

Besides being extremely user friendly and ´smart´, Linx Wallet is the first wallet in the world that is GAS FREE.
